# Privacy Notice

- **Camera access**
  - The app accesses your webcam only after you click Start and your browser grants permission.
  - You can revoke access anytime via your browser’s site settings.

- **On-device processing**
  - Face detection, recognition, and expression analysis run locally in your browser.
  - Images and descriptors are not transmitted to a server by default.

- **Local storage**
  - If you enroll a face, the name and descriptor are saved in your browser’s `localStorage`.
  - You can export or clear this data in-app. Clearing browser storage also removes it.

- **Uploads**
  - Uploaded images are handled in-memory and used only for on-device detection.
  - They are not uploaded anywhere unless you explicitly export or share them.

- **Third-party resources**
  - Model files can be loaded from a local folder or a CDN. When using a CDN, your browser fetches model files from that domain.

- **Disabling features**
  - Use the Stop button to end camera streaming.
  - Toggle off emotion recognition in Settings if you prefer not to compute expressions.
  - Use Settings or browser controls to pick front/back camera on mobile.

- **Contact**
  - For questions or concerns, contact the maintainers via the repository’s issue tracker.
